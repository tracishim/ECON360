# ECON360: International Economics (Coding & Empirical Materials)

This repository contains teaching materials—primarily coding and empirical exercises—that accompany the theory portion of **ECON 360 (Undergraduate International Economics)**.

## Why Coding Matters for Economists

Like it or not, modern economics is data-driven. Whether you’re analyzing data patterns or estimating policy effects, strong coding skills are no longer optional—they are a core part of being a competitive economist. Like math and theory, coding is a skill that improves with constant practice and sharpening.

## Why GitHub?

GitHub is the industry standard platform for sharing code, collaborating on research, and managing projects. Learning to use GitHub now will help you:
- Organize and version your work
- Collaborate efficiently with classmates and coauthors
- Access high-quality open-source economic tools and examples

**Bonus:** With your **SDSU student account**, you get **GitHub Copilot for free** (a ~$20/month value). Copilot is an AI coding assistant that can help you write, understand, and debug code—perfect for learning faster.

## Automation & Reproducibility

Coding is not just about writing scripts once—it’s about **automation and reproducibility**. Automating data cleaning, analysis, and visualization saves time, reduces errors, and ensures your results can be replicated by others (including your future self).

## Software for This Course

You are encouraged to use **Stata** or **R** for the empirical components of this course. *(Yes, I’m old. I still use Stata.)*

- **Stata (Student License):**  
  Get a discounted student license here:

- **R (Free & Open Source):**  
  Download R: https://cran.r-project.org/  
  Download RStudio: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

Both tools are widely used in economics, and the skills you learn here will transfer well beyond this class.
